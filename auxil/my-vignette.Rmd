# Introduction

IMPACT~NCD~ is an open-source microsimulation modelling framework for
public health policy planning and decision-making in non-communicable
disease prevention. The epidemiological engine of the modelling
framework translates changes in the trends of disease risk factors into
changes in disease incidence and case fatality and subsequent disease
prevalence. The policy layer of the framework complements the
epidemiological engine and translates policy changes (hypothetical or
real) into changes in the trends of disease risk factors.

IMPACT~NCD~ has been used extensively to model primary prevention
policies nationally in England, Brazil, and the US, and locally in
Liverpool.[1--10] A simplified diagram of the model structure is
presented in [Figure 1‑1]{.underline}. At the core of the model is an
epidemiological engine which includes age, sex, area deprivation
(English Index of Multiple Deprivation), smoking, environmental tobacco
smoke exposure, alcohol consumption, fruit & vegetable consumption,
physical activity, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and total
serum cholesterol, as risk factors. The diseases modelled from risk
factor trends include coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, type
2 diabetes mellitus, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer,
prostate cancer, chronic kidney disease, dementia, atrial fibrillation,
asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, plus twelve
additional conditions that are modelled from past trends in disease
incidence and mortality. Notably, diseases can be risk factors for other
diseases (i.e. diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for coronary heart
disease). The policy layer is dedicated to modelling either a specific
public health policy formulation or a hypothetical scenario and consists
of a mathematical/statistical model of the policy.

This iteration of IMPACT~NCD~ uses data from the Health Survey for
England (HSE) to inform trends in risk factors and linked primary care
records (CPRD Aurum linked to HES inpatient, HES outpatient, and Office
for National Statistics (ONS) mortality records; described in the
[Disease module]{.underline} section) to inform trends in disease
incidence, prevalence, and disease-specific mortality. ONS population
estimates and projections are used to inform estimates of the population
size and structure and to calibrate mortality.

The IMPACT~NCD~ framework is modular and can grow in several directions,
with contributions from us and others. For example, it allows
third-parties to develop policy layers independently and hook them to
the epidemiological engine. The open-source licence (GPLv3) ensures
transparency and accountability while promoting collaborative work
throughout development and deployment. The source code of the current
implementation is available at
<https://github.com/ChristK/IMPACTncd_Engl/tree/Report_1>.

# Epidemiological engine

## High-level description

The epidemiological engine of IMPACT~NCD~ is a discrete-time, dynamic,
stochastic microsimulation consisting of three modules: the
**Sociodemographic** module, the **Exposure** module, and the
**Disease** module.

Within the IMPACT~NCD~ epidemiological engine, each unit is a synthetic
individual (simulant) represented by a record containing a unique
identifier and a set of associated attributes. The microsimulation then
projects the life-course of each synthetic individual.

The attributes of each synthetic individual include sociodemographic
characteristics, exposures to risk factors, acquired diseases, and cause
of death if relevant.

Specific attributes include:

1.  Age, sex, ethnicity, region, and index of multiple deprivation (IMD;
    deciles) as sociodemographic exposures.

2.  Alcohol intake, smoking status (current smoker/ ex-smoker/
    never-smoker), smoking duration, smoking intensity, environmental
    tobacco exposure, fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, and
    physical activity as behavioural risk exposure variables.

3.  Body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and total
    serum cholesterol as biological risk exposures.

4.  The risk for thirteen diseases is modelled explicitly: asthma,
    atrial fibrillation (AF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic
    obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary heart disease (CHD),
    hypertension, dementia, stroke, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
    breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer.
    The risk for these conditions is modelled from relevant exposures to
    sociodemographic, behavioural, and biological risk factor
    attributes, as well as certain prevalent conditions. For instance,
    the risk of heart failure depends on age, sex, ethnicity, region,
    IMD, and prevalent CHD, COPD, T2DM and hypertension. Finally, the
    risk for a further 13 conditions -- alcohol misuse, anxiety and
    depression, connective tissue disorders, constipation, epilepsy,
    hearing loss, heart failure, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), other
    cancers, pain, psychosis and bipolar disorders, rheumatoid
    arthritis, and type 1 diabetes -- is directly driven by past trends
    in the disease incidence and sociodemographic exposures. Some of
    these conditions are combined in post hoc analyses to derive the 20
    conditions for the Cambridge Multimorbidity Score (CMS) score.[11]
    The [Disease module]{.underline} section summarises the modelling
    approach, and [Supplementary materials A: Disease module
    details]{.underline} gives more detail on the modelling and data
    sources for each condition. Based on their risk of developing any of
    these conditions, simulants may develop some during their life
    course.

5.  Mortality from the diseases listed in 4 or any other cause is
    recorded if it occurs.

All these attributes are updated in discrete annual steps according to a
set of stochastic rules. We structured these rules based on
well-established epidemiological principles. Specifically, behavioural
risk exposures are conditional on sociodemographic exposures; biological
risk exposures are conditional on behavioural and sociodemographic
exposures, and diseases are conditional on biological, behavioural, and
sociodemographic exposures, as well as diagnosis of other conditions.
Finally, mortality is conditional on sociodemographic, behavioural, and
disease exposures.

The life course of synthetic individuals is simulated as many times as
the number of scenarios to be modelled (one for this report), using the
same random numbers for all policy scenarios to reduce stochastic noise.
One of the scenarios is always the 'baseline' scenario with which all
remaining policy scenarios are compared. In this report, the baseline
scenario is that of continuing trends in risk factors. Comparing the
disease outcomes from the life courses under the baseline scenario
versus the policy scenarios generates the health impact of the policy
scenarios. The output of the epidemiological engine is a dataset
containing the adult life course of the simulated synthetic individuals
with all the attributes mentioned above recorded annually for every
scenario. From this dataset of life course trajectories, summary
measures such as average CMS, mortality, and disease incidence and
prevalence can be calculated annually.

As we mentioned above, the epidemiological engine of IMPACT~NCD~
consists of three modules: the **sociodemographic** module, the
**exposure** module, and the **disease** module. In the following
paragraphs, we will describe these three modules. [Table
2‑1]{.underline} summarises the key assumptions and limitations of the
IMPACT~NCD~ microsimulation model.

Table 2.1 IMPACT~NCD~ key assumptions and limitations

  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------------
  Model component     **Key assumptions**

  Sociodemographic    Migration is not modelled explicitly in the model.
  module              However, the model outputs are calibrated to ONS
                      population projections by Local Authority (LA),
                      which take into account migration. Nevertheless, we
                      assume that migrants have similar characteristics
                      to the indigenous population.

                      Social mobility is not considered.

                      Decile groups of the index of multiple deprivation
                      (DIMD) is a relative marker of (area) deprivation
                      with several versions since 2003. We have used the
                      2015 version and assume it is constant throughout
                      the simulation.

  Exposure module     We assume that the surveys used are truly
                      representative of the population. For example, the
                      adjustments for selection bias in the Health Survey
                      for England are adequate.

                      On average, simulants remain in the same exposure
                      quantile throughout their life.

                      The linear correlations in exposure quantiles
                      remain constant over time (i.e. the clustering of
                      exposures in some subpopulations).

  Disease module      We assume multiplicative risk effects.

                      We assume log-linear dose-response for the
                      continuous risk factors.

                      We assume that the effects of the risk factors on
                      incidence and mortality are equal.

                      We assume a mean lag time between exposure and
                      outcome of about 4-5 years for most
                      exposure/outcome pairs, except for cancers, for
                      which we assume a mean lag time of 9 years.

                      We assume 100% risk reversibility for all exposures
                      except smoking. We allow smoking to have a
                      cumulative effect on the risk for COPD and lung,
                      breast, and colorectal cancers.

                      We assume that trends in disease incidence are
                      attributable only to trends of the relevant
                      modelled risk factors or other diseases modelled.

                      We assume that the linked primary care data used to
                      model disease trends over time represents
                      England\'s adult population.

                      For cancers, we assume that survival ten years
                      after diagnosis equals remission.

                      For all conditions other than cancer (see point
                      above), pain, constipation, asthma, alcohol
                      problems, and anxiety/depression, we assume
                      conditions are chronic.

  Continuing risk     We assume that trends in risk factor exposures and
  factor trends       disease incidence continue to follow log-linear
  scenario (baseline) trends.
  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------------

## Sociodemographic module

The first year of every simulation in IMPACT~NCD~ is 2013, so we could
use the overlapping period 2013-19 to calibrate and validate the model.

For each simulation, the algorithm in the module:

1.  Identifies the Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) that constitute the
    user area selection; for this report, this was set to the whole of
    England.

2.  Draws 200,000 synthetic individuals, aged 30 to 99, from the joint
    age- and sex-distribution of the identified LSOAs. This is a default
    value that can be modified by the user. The joint age-
    sex-distribution for each LSOA for 2013 is informed by the Office
    for National Statistics (ONS) population estimates. [12]

3.  Assigns to each synthetic individual an IMD score based on their
    LSOA.

4.  Probabilistically assigns to each synthetic individual an ethnicity
    based on their age group, sex, and LSOA. The ethnicity mixture of
    each LSOA is informed by the 2011 Census.[13] We include nine
    ethnicities in the model (white, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi,
    other Asian, black Caribbean, black African, Chinese, and other).

5.  Assigns to each synthetic individual a Strategic Health Authority
    (SHA) based on their LSOA. SHA is the smallest geographical area
    accessible in the Health Survey for England series and is mostly
    aligned with English Regions. We use this in the exposure module, as
    we describe in the next section.

So far, the algorithm has created a synthetic population that is a
snapshot of the English population in 2013. The following steps of the
algorithm create backward and forward projections of the synthetic
population that are essential to model exposure time trends and time
lags between exposures and diseases.

The backward projection of the synthetic population goes back to 2003;
therefore, the maximum time lag we allow in the model is ten years. As
everyone alive and older than 30 years old in 2013 was alive in 2003,
the algorithm simply creates the back projections by appropriately
reducing the age of the synthetic individuals while keeping constant all
other variables.

Similarly, for the forward projections, we project until 2043, and the
algorithm increases the age of the synthetic individuals while keeping
all other variables constant. For forward projections, mortality needs
to be considered. We describe mortality with the disease module as
disease-specific mortality is closely related to disease prevalence.
IMPACT~NCD~ follows an open cohort approach. Every simulated year from
2013 onwards, a new cohort of 30-year-old synthetic individuals enters
the model. The same sources inform the cohort size and the joint age-
sex- ethnicity-distribution we described above. For example, in 2014,
the new 30-year-old cohort will be informed by the population size and
the joint age- sex- ethnicity-distribution of those who were 29 years
old in 2013. The approach may be crude; however, the final model outputs
are directly standardised to ONS national or local authority population
projection estimates as applicable. [14,15]

## Exposure module

This module simulates the adult life course exposures of synthetic
individuals based on the HSE series between 2003 and 2014.[16--27] We
followed the same general principles for all simulated exposures. First,
we fit an appropriate statistical model to the HSE data with the
exposure of interest as the dependent variable and some functions of the
year, age, sex, QIMD, ethnicity, and SHA as independent variables. Then,
we use the statistical model to predict the exposure level of every
synthetic individual in the simulation based on their sociodemographic
characteristics estimated from the sociodemographic module.

Including year as an independent variable in our exposure model allows
us to extract the trends from the HSE series and project them into the
future. Furthermore, it allows us to make backward projections of
exposures when we simulate time lags. For example, for a synthetic
female aged 30 in 2013, we can estimate her BMI in 2003, when she was 20
and in 2033, when she would be 50. To avoid excessively fast changes in
exposure trends and to reflect our belief that decays and growths in
natural phenomena are rarely linear, we included the natural logarithm
of years in the statistical models assuming logarithmic trends.

We used logit ordinal regression to model exposures that were recorded
as ordinal categorical variables in HSE. We used generalised additive
models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) for all other
exposures.[28,29] These are flexible statistical models that can make
all parameters of an assumed distribution for the dependent variable
conditional to some function of the independent variables. For example,
GAMLSS can model the mean and the standard deviation of a dependent
normally distributed variable conditional on the predictors, while a
linear regression only models the mean. Supplementary materials B [Table
B‑1]{.underline} summarises our modelling approach for all the exposures
in the model.

![](vertopal_d77ff0cf293d49789d81815e1bced1b6/media/image1.png){width="5.738194444444445in"
height="4.063888888888889in"}The approach described above provides us
with equations to estimate the distribution of the exposure to a risk
factor for a given time and the sociodemographic characteristics of a
synthetic individual. When the synthetic individual enters the
simulation, a vector of random numbers between 0 and 1 and of size equal
to the number of the modelled exposures is allocated to them. Each one
of the numbers represents the percentile of the relevant exposure
distribution. The principle is that synthetic individuals retain their
percentiles throughout their life course (this is known as the rank
stability assumption). [30] For example, in 2013, a 40-year-old male
synthetic individual living in a QIMD 3 area with an SBP of 120 mmHg has
a SBP percentile of 0.52. Twenty years later, the same synthetic
individual retained their percentile score for SBP. However, their SBP
is now estimated to be 137.6 mmHg because the SBP distribution has
changed to reflect the SBP of 60-year-old men living in a QIMD 3 area in
2032 ([Figure 2‑1]{.underline}). In IMPACT~NCD~, we allow the
percentiles of the synthetic individuals to fluctuate every year using
random walks to relax the rank stability assumption.

### Clustering of risk factors

Finally, exposures in individuals are correlated. For example, people
with a high BMI may also have high total cholesterol and hypertension.
Some of these correlations reflect strong and well-established causal
mechanisms and the cross-sectional design of HSE biases some. The method
we described above captures some of these correlations by including
exposures as independent variables in the statistical models for
estimating exposures. For example, we included BMI as a predictor for
T2DM. Going a step further, we model the full correlation structure in
HSE using the following approach:

1.  We used the exposure models to impute missing variables in HSE

2.  We used the quantile function of the distribution estimated by the
    exposure models to convert exposures in HSE to percentiles. Because
    the distributions were conditional on the independent variables used
    in each model, the percentiles are adjusted for these variables
    (i.e. age, sex, quintiles of IMD, etc.)

3.  We estimated the linear correlation matrix of the percentiles of the
    exposures of interest in HSE using Pearson's correlation.

4.  We used the linear correlation matrix from #3 to generate streams of
    uniforms between 0 and 1 with a correlation structure similar to the
    one observed in HSE. [31]

5.  We used the correlates streams of random numbers from #4 as the
    exposure percentiles for the synthetic individuals.

For simplicity, we assumed that the correlation structure of the
exposure percentiles remains constant over time.

## Disease module 

The previous two modules for demographics and exposure generate a
dynamic close-to-reality synthetic population composed of the adult life
course exposures of each synthetic individual. The disease module then
translates these exposures to disease incidence using a
population-attributable risk fraction approach (PARF).[32] We will
first describe how the disease incidence is simulated in the model and
then how the model simulates mortality.

We have modelled conditions in several different ways depending on the
disease and the currently accepted causal associations between risk
factors and diseases. The included risk factors and the modelled
relationships between risk factors and disease incidence are those where
sufficient, good quality data on relative risks were available and where
there is sufficient evidence of a causal relationship between a risk
factor and incidence of disease. Relative risks were obtained from
published systematic reviews and meta-analyses supplemented with
systematic literature searches. [Supplementary materials A: Disease
module details]{.underline} include a summary of all data sources.
Furthermore, we have modelled conditions at a more granular level for
some of the conditions within the Cambridge Multimorbidity Score and
then aggregated them. [Table 2‑2]{.underline} summarises the modelling
approach for each condition, and further detail is given in
[Supplementary materials A: Disease module details.]{.underline}

### Disease incidence

To estimate the individualised annual probability of a synthetic
individual developing a specific disease conditional on their cumulative
risk exposures, we follow a 3-step approach:

**Step 1**. The incidence proportion attributable to each modelled risk
factor by age, sex, and DIMD is estimated, assuming a specific time lag
between exposure and disease. The relationships between exposures and
disease incidence included in the model are outlined in [Table
2‑2]{.underline}. The time lags in the model vary stochastically between
1 and 10 years following a shifted binomial distribution. We set the
mean lag time for each pair of risk exposure and disease combination
according to the best possible empirical data based on the observation
period of cohort studies and time to risk reversal in randomised
clinical trials (see [Table 2‑3]{.underline} and [Supplementary
materials A: Disease module details]{.underline}).

**Step 2**. The portion of the disease incidence attributable to all the
modelled risk factors is estimated and subtracted from the total
incidence for 2013, assuming multiplicative risks.

**Step 3**. The probability of developing the disease is estimated for
each individual in the synthetic population and is used in an
independent Bernoulli trial to select those who finally develop the
disease.

SBP = Systolic Blood Pressure; ETS = environmental tobacco smoke

The implementation of the above method is described in more detail using
CHD as an example. The same process is used for all modelled diseases
except type 1 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, other connective
tissue disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, and hearing loss which will
be described separately.

**Step 1**

PARF is an epidemiological measure that estimates the proportion of the
disease attributable to an associated risk factor. It depends on the
relative risk associated with the risk factor and the prevalence of the
risk factor in the population. In a microsimulation context where
exposures to risk factors are known at the individual level and assuming
multiplicative risk factors, PARF can be estimated using the formula:

$$PARF = \ 1 - \frac{n}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(RR_{i1}*\ RR_{i2}*\ldots*\ RR_{ik})}}$$

where $n$ is the number of synthetic individuals in the population, and
${RR}_{i1\ldots ik}$ are the relative risks of the risk factors
associated with CHD for each individual $i$. We calculated PARF based on
the above formula stratified by age, sex, DIMD, ethnicity and SHA.
Consistent with findings from the respective meta-analyses used for
IMPACT~NCD~ (Supplementary materials A [Table A‑2]{.underline}), SBP
below 115 mmHg, TC below 3.8 mmol/l and BMI below 22 Kg/m^2­^ were
considered to have a relative risk of 1. Similarly, consumption of eight
or more portions of F&V and five or more active days (more than 30
minutes of moderate to vigorous activity) per week were also considered
to have a relative risk of 1. All the relative risks were taken from
published meta-analyses and empirical studies (for references, see
[Supplementary materials A: Disease module details]{.underline} where we
describe each disease).

**Step 2**

The incidence of CHD not attributable to the modelled risk factors can
be estimated by the formula:

$$I_{Theoretical\ minimum} = \ I_{Observed}*(1 - PAF)$$

Where $I_{Observed}$ is the CHD incidence and $PAF$ is from Step 1.
$I_{Theoretical\ minimum}$ represents CHD incidence if all the modelled
risk factors were at optimal levels. The theoretical minimum incidence
is calculated by age, sex, and QIMD only in the initial year of the
simulation, and it is assumed to be stable after that.

**Step 3**

Assuming that $I_{Theoretical\ minimum}$ is the annual baseline
probability of a synthetic individual to develop CHD for a given age,
sex, DIMD, ethnicity and SHA due to risk factors not included in the
model (i.e. genetics, air pollution, dietary exposures beyond fruit &
veg etc.), the individualised annual probability of developing CHD,
$\mathbb{P}\left( \text{CHD\ |\ age,\ sex,}\text{\ }\text{age,\ sex,\ DIMD,\ ethnicity\ SHA}\text{,}\text{\ exposures} \right)$,
given their risk factors were estimated by the formula:

$$\mathbb{P}\left( CHD\ |\ age,sex,age,sex,DIMD,ethnicity\ SHA\ ,\ exposures \right) = = \ I_{Theoretical\ minimum}*RR_{i1}*RR_{i2}*RR_{i3}*\ldots*RR_{ik}$$

Where $RR_{i1\ \ldots\ ik}$ are the relative risks that are related to
the specific risk exposures of the synthetic individual, same as in step
1.

#### Estimating the observed incidence probability $I_{Observed}$

To estimate the observed incidence probability $I_{Observed}$ we fitted
a binomial GAMLSS model to the linked primary care data (CPRD, HES, ONS)
with disease incidence probability as the dependent variable and year,
age, sex, DIMD, ethnicity and SHA as the independent variables. For type
1 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, other connective tissue
disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, and hearing loss that do not depend
on any risk factor, we used these models to project their future
incidence, assuming log-linear trends. To account for biases in the
data, we injected uncertainty of ± 5% (relative) to the estimated
disease incidence probability during the simulation.

#### Initial prevalence

For the initial simulation year, some synthetic individuals must be
allocated as prevalent cases for each modelled disease. We fitted a
binomial GAMLSS model to the linked primary care data (CPRD, HES, ONS)
with disease prevalence probability as the dependent variable and year,
age, sex, DIMD, ethnicity and SHA as the independent variables. We used
these models to allocate the initial year disease prevalence in the
simulation.

#### Conditions with recovery and recurrence: asthma, anxiety and depression, constipation, pain, alcohol problems and cancers

Asthma, anxiety and depression, constipation, pain, and alcohol problems
were treated as short-term conditions that can go into remission and
reoccur. Spell duration was stochastically derived from observed
durations in the CPRD data. In addition to the risk factor relationships
described in [Table 2‑3]{.underline}, incident cases of these five
conditions were associated with a previous history of the condition.
Cancers were assumed to go into remission after 10 years, but recurrence
was not modelled conditional on cancer history. All other conditions
were treated as life-long.

#### Dependencies between conditions 

As the Cambridge Multimorbidity Score (CMS) is a composite measure, it
is derived from the combination of conditions an individual has. We,
therefore, modelled dependencies between conditions with strong
correlations based on our epidemiological understanding and the
correlation structure in our linked CPRD data using GAMLSS models to
derive relative risks for the effect of prevalent condition A on the
incidence of condition B. [Figure 2‑2]{.underline} displays the
dependencies modelled between a prevalent condition (on the y-axis) and
the subsequent incidence of another condition (on the x-axis). Disease
dependencies modelled for each incident condition are summarised in
[Supplementary materials A: Disease module details]{.underline}.

### Disease duration 

For existing prevalent conditions among simulants at the start of the
simulation (2013), the number of years lived with each condition is
assigned based on sociodemographic characteristics and duration of the
condition derived from administrative data, as derived from GAMLSS
models fitted in the linked CPRD data. For the five conditions with
remission and recurrence, these models also inform the duration of each
disease occurrence.

### Mortality

All synthetic individuals are exposed to the risk of dying from any of
their acquired modelled conditions or any other non-modelled cause. We
treat the latter as a condition that everyone is a prevalent case of.
That allowed us to treat it like any other condition in the model.
Hearing loss, IBS, asthma, anxiety and depression, constipation, pain,
hypertension, and alcohol problems have very low case fatality; hence,
we assumed that mortality from these conditions is 0. Furthermore, our
dataset had very few CKD deaths, and we could not estimate CKD case
fatality accurately. Hence, we assume that CKD mortality is 0 as well.
For all other conditions, we fitted GAMLSS models to estimate their case
fatality (the probability of a prevalent case of a condition dying of
this condition), conditional on year, age, sex, and DIMD. For conditions
with high mortality (i.e. CHD), we additionally decomposed case fatality
to the first-year post-diagnosis case fatality and the second-year
onwards post-diagnosis case fatality. For all potentially fatal
conditions, we applied the same PARF approach described above for
incidence to the case fatality. Therefore, we allow exposures to risk
factors to influence the mortality probability of the simulants. The
exception is conditions with explicit first-year case fatality, for
which we assumed it is independent of exposure to risk factors and is
only conditional to age, sex, and DIMD.

Additionally, using a similar approach to the one we used to model
disease incidence, we allowed prevalent cases of T2DM, synthetic
individuals with SBP higher than 140 mmHg, active smokers, those with
one or less active day per week, and those with excessive alcohol intake
to experience higher non-modelled cause mortality rates. [33]

#### Mortality calibration 

All-cause mortality in our linked CPRD dataset was lower than the
official mortality estimates that the ONS reports. This appears to be a
known issue in CPRD.[34] We, therefore, calibrated the CPRD-driven
mortality in the model to the ONS estimates. We first fitted functional
demographic models by sex and DIMD to the ONS mortality rate estimates
by single year of age from 2001 to 2019. [35,36] Using the R package
\'demography\', we projected all-cause mortality rates to the simulation
horizon (2043). [37] Functional demographic models are generalisations
of the Lee-Carter demographic model, influenced by ideas from functional
data analysis and non-parametric smoothing. [38] We then inflated the
case fatality rates of potentially fatal diseases in the simulation by
an age/sex/DIMD-specific calibration factor to track the projections of
the functional demographic model.

# Population attributable risk fraction (PARF)

The model allows for changes in the exposures of synthetic individuals
based on defined 'what if' scenarios. The change in exposures allus us
to calculate the individual risk factor effecrs on trends in modelled
incidence. We can then compare the disease-related events between the
counterfactual life courses.

### PARF calculations

We can use the alternative scenario function to estimate PARFs - the
proportion of incidence of a condition attributable to specific risk
factors. The PARF analysis runs from 2013 and compares the baseline
model scenario with scenarios in which each risk factor is set to the
optimal level in 2013 (see [Table 3‑1]{.underline}). As the lag time
between exposure and incidence differs by condition, for each condition,
we compare the baseline and optimal scenario incidences at the latest
lag time ([Table 3‑2]{.underline}). The proportion of the baseline
incidence removed under the optimal level scenario gives the PARF. As
PARFs are multiplicative and not additive, an additional scenario where
all risk factors are set to optimal levels is used to apply a correction
factor. Note that in the current implementation, we did not consider the
mediated effects of some of the risk factors. I.e. when BMI is reduced,
we would expect total cholesterol and SBP to be reduced by some degree
for physiological reasons, which we currently ignore.

# Model outputs

The population in the model for this report was set for England. The
model has a time horizon of 30 years, from 2013 to 2043. The simulation
begins in 2013 to allow for validation and calibration with the linked
primary care data used to inform the model. The model outputs produce
life-course trajectories for each simulant, including CMS scores. From
these, annual summary measures such as incidence, prevalence and
mortality rates are calculated. These measures can then be compared
across time and between scenarios to estimate the effects and equity of
different scenarios. All outcome measures can be standardised to the
2013 European Standard Population or not, and stratification is possible
by year, sex, DIMD and age group allowing examination of how effects
differ across sub-populations.

From the estimated mortality rates of the model, we can also estimate
life expectancy as follows. The 2010 and 2019 estimates for period life
expectancy use historical ONS mortality rates​, and the 2040 estimates
use projected mortality changes from the microsimulation model applied
to 2019 ONS mortality rates. We then apply REAL Centre estimates of the
proportion of people in different health states by 5-year age bands to
the mortality rates to get estimates for the time spent in different
states of ill health in 2010 and 2019. For 2040, we use REAL Centre
estimates of the proportion of people in different health states by age
group and sex from 2019 for those aged under 30 and assume no changes to
these proportions until 2040. For those aged 30 and over for 2040, we
use the projected estimates of the proportion of people in different
health states by age group and sex from the model.

Crucially, the model is a dynamic, open-cohort microsimulation model.
That means the model is trying to estimate the actual impact of the
scenarios within a dynamic population where people are born, people age,
people's risk factors change, and people die. The detailed modelling of
the population dynamics in our model is thus different from many
economic models, which are often closed-cohort, meaning they follow the
same cohort of the population over time and often have a lifetime
horizon.

### Uncertainty and probabilistic sensitivity analysis

IMPACT~NCD~ implements a 2^nd^ order Monte Carlo approach to estimate
uncertainty intervals (UI) for each scenario. [39,40] For each
iteration, a different set of input parameters is used by sampling from
the respective distributions of input parameters. We assumed log-normal
distributions for relative risks and hazard ratios, normal distributions
for coefficients of linear regression equations, and uniform
distributions for estimates of incidence, prevalence, and case fatality
rates. Specifically, for relative risks and hazard ratios, the
distributions were bounded above 1 when the mean was above 1 and vice
versa.

IMPACT~NCD~ allows stochastic uncertainty, parameter uncertainty,
individual heterogeneity, and to some extent, structural uncertainty to
be propagated in the reported UI. In IMPACT~NCD~, we minimise stochastic
uncertainty by using the same random numbers for all scenarios when
appropriate. The following example illustrates the different types of
uncertainty considered in the model. Let us assume that the annual risk
for CHD is 5%. Suppose we apply this risk to all individuals and
randomly draw from a Bernoulli distribution with 𝑝 = 5% to select those
who will manifest CHD. In that case, we only consider stochastic
uncertainty. Our model minimises stochastic uncertainty when we compare
different policy scenarios by using the same random numbers for all
scenarios, where appropriate. If we allow the annual risk for CHD to be
conditional on individual characteristics (i.e. age, sex, exposure to
risk factors), then individual heterogeneity is considered. Finally,
when the uncertainty of the relative risks due to sampling errors is
considered in estimating the annual risk for CHD, the parameter
uncertainty is considered. From these three types of uncertainty, only
the parameter uncertainty could be reduced by better studies in the
future.

The structure of the model is grounded in fundamental epidemiological
ideas and well-established causal pathways on which exposures are
causally related to the specific NCDs which are explicitly modelled. For
example, hypertension is causally related to CVD but not lung cancer.
Hence, structural sensitivity analysis is not necessary to explore the
possibility of hypertension being a risk factor for lung cancer.
Therefore, we considered this type of uncertainty relatively small and
did not study it in detail, with one exception: the discrete-time bias
that arises from the fact that time in IMPACT~NCD~ is not continuous. A
synthetic individual within the model may die of multiple causes within
one year; however, the discrete-time nature of the simulation does not
allow the identification of the cause that 'killed' the simulant first.
Every time this happens to a simulant, we randomly select a cause of
death from the list of all the terminal events that occurred for the
simulant that year. Hence, we propagate discrete-time uncertainty to the
output.

# Validation and calibration

We validated the IMPACT~NCD~ epidemiological engine using internal
validation plotting the modelled exposures prevalence and disease
incidence against the observed exposures prevalence and disease
incidence in HSE and linked primary care data, respectively. Mortality
in the model is calibrated to mortality projections as described above
([Mortality]{.underline}). We present the relevant validation plots for
modelled exposures in [Supplementary materials B: exposure modelling
details and validation]{.underline} stratified by year and age group and
by quintiles of IMD and age group. [Figure 5‑1]{.underline} shows the
modelled prevalence of CMS \> 1.5 (defined as 'major illness' in this
report) against the observed CPRD Aurum prevalence. The decline from
2017 in the observed data is an artefact caused by the case definition
and consequent prevalence of pain. Validation plots (age-sex-dimd
standardised) for incidence, case fatality, and prevalence of individual
conditions are shown in [Supplementary materials A: Disease module
details]{.underline}. Additionally, we have produced and inspected plots
for multiple combinations of stratification levels that are available on
request. Overall, the plots suggest that IMPACT~NCD~ captures exposure
trends and translates them to disease incidence and mortality reasonably
well for the purpose of this project.

# Definition of Cambridge Multimorbidity Score and defining conditions in primary care data 

The Cambridge Multimorbidity Score (CMS) is used to define levels of ill
health for an individual and for the population. [11] The CMS assigns
a weight or 'score' to 20 conditions on the basis of how the illness
affects their use of primary care, emergency health services and the
patient's likelihood of death (see [Table 6‑1]{.underline} below for the
exact weight of each condition).

Our projections draw on detailed patient-level administrative data
linked to primary care (CPRD Aurum) and secondary care (Hospital Episode
Statistics) from a sample of 1.7 million patients. The data include
chronic conditions diagnosed in primary care and the Index of Multiple
Deprivation (IMD) score for each patient's local area, age, sex,
ethnicity and region. Since our analysis relies on diagnosis data from
patient records, all our projections refer to *diagnosed* prevalence,
incidence and illness throughout the report. Due to our focus on the
long-term trends in ageing and health and due to our data sample being
available up to 2019/20, we do not include COVID-19 and its impacts in
our analysis.

The use of diagnosed conditions in administrative primary care data to
measure levels of illness has several advantages over using survey data.
Administrative data tend to have larger and more representative patient
samples and are less subjective than self-reported measures of health in
surveys. [41] It is, however, important to note that rates of
diagnosis can be impacted by patients' access to care and changes in
diagnosis policy and practices over time. Several studies have found
underdiagnosis in COPD, [42] hypertension, [43] type 2 diabetes
[44] and dementia, [45] so it is likely that the true burden of
illness will be higher than what we estimate in this report.

The CMS is used to define levels of ill health for an individual and for
the population. [11] The score provides a metric which allows
comparisons of levels of illness across conditions and over time. The
CMS assigns a weight or 'score' to 20 conditions based on how the
illness affects their use of primary care, emergency health services and
the patient's likelihood of death ([Table 6‑1]{.underline}). For
instance, cancer and heart failure are given higher scores than
hypertension (high blood pressure) or hearing loss because they are more
likely to lead to death, unplanned hospital admissions or greater
primary care needs. For those with multimorbidity, scores are added
together, meaning individuals with the same score can have a different
number and combination of conditions.

We use the CMS rather than other multimorbidity indices such as Charlson
[46] and Elixhauser, [47] as it is more representative of conditions
that are highly prevalent today and because it outperforms the Charlson
index in predicting primary care consultations and hospital admissions
and, to a lesser extent, mortality. [11]

Note: 1. Per person-year. 2. Per 1000 person-years. 3. Unit change
associated with a change of 1 standard deviation in each of the 3
outcomes. Negative weights can be interpreted as reflecting a negative
association with the outcome of interest after controlling for other
conditions. Constipation, when diagnosed in primary care data, is likely
linked to the side effects of taking opioid analgesics (strong pain
killers such as codeine phosphate) and other medication. Chronic pain
that leads to opioid prescribing tends to be worse, and therefore
constipation could be linked with higher care needs.

The 2010 and 2019 estimates for period life expectancy use historical
ONS mortality rates, [48] and the 2040 estimates use projected
mortality changes from the model applied to 2019 ONS mortality rates. We
then apply REAL Centre estimates of the proportion of people in
different health states by 5-year age bands to the mortality rates to
get estimates for the time spent in different states of ill health in
2010 and 2019. For 2040, we use REAL Centre estimates of the proportion
of people in different health states by age group and sex from 2019 for
those under 30 and assume no changes to these proportions until 2040.
For those aged 30 and over for 2040, we use the projected estimates of
the proportion of people in different health states by age group and sex
from the microsimulation model.

We use ONS historical mid-year population estimates for 2019, and ONS
2020 projected population estimates for 2040. [49,50] We then apply
REAL Centre estimates of the proportion of people in different health
states by 5-year age bands and sex to the population estimates to get
the numbers of people in different illness states in 2019. For 2040, we
use REAL Centre estimates of the proportion of people in different
health states by age group and sex from 2019 for those aged under 30 and
assume no changes to these proportions until 2040. For those aged 30 and
over for the year 2040, we use the projected estimates of the proportion
of people in different health states by age group and sex from the
microsimulation model.

Of the 20 conditions in our analysis, most are considered "permanent"
because there is no cure: once someone is diagnosed with a condition,
like atrial fibrillation, they will forever have that condition. For six
of the conditions observed to be more transient in the data, we allow
patients to go into remission: cancer, asthma, anxiety and depression,
alcohol problems, constipation and chronic pain.

The code lists used for the CMS, available online, [51] have been
developed using CPRD GOLD based on read codes, medcodes and prodcodes.
In this report, we have data for CPRD Aurum. [Table 6‑1]{.underline}
summarises the definition for each condition used in this report and in
the original CMS paper.

We use code lists for CPRD developed by Anna Head, available on GitHub
[52] and adapted from code lists from the CALIBER algorithms[^2].

# Strengths and limitations of this modelling approach

The IMPACT~NCD~ model is an advanced, validated, flexible
microsimulation of the dynamics of NCDs in a population, including
important NCDs that are amenable to prevention and provide support to a
range of capabilities to conduct state-of-the-art effectiveness and
equity analysis.

The complex dynamic generated by reductions in risk factors and disease
trends needs to be modelled for a more realistic estimate of the future
burden of illness from a societal perspective, which includes competing
causes of illness and death. For instance, the model factors in that if
CHD incidence is delayed, people may live longer and be more likely to
get any of the other modelled diseases. This was evident in our
projections, where, for example, the number of COPD cases increased
because of people living longer. The modelling of individual conditions
allows in-depth exploration of how trends in risk factors may impact the
future burden of multimorbidity.

All such modelling analyses have limitations. This iteration of the
model uses exposure data from HSE waves up to 2014; however, we know
that there have been changes in more recent years to both overall trends
and socioeconomic inequalities. Furthermore, the data that informs our
model is from before the coronavirus pandemic and therefore does not
capture any of the impacts of the coronavirus or pandemic-related
restrictions. The use of HSE data from 2003-2014 was based on several
reasons. Most importantly, the consistent recording of risk factors
based on age, decile of IMD, ethnicity and geographic region over time.
This allows us to separately model the projected incidence of long-term
illness for different population subgroups. Although later versions of
HSE are available, differences in survey methodology meant it was not
possible to include them in this model. As we have used data from HSE
for the period between 2003-2014, some trends in risk factors differ
from those reported by OHID and PHE Fingertips for the period between
2014-present day.

We derived trends in disease incidence, prevalence, and mortality, from
CPRD data (GP practices) linked to HES (secondary care data) and ONS
(cause of death) records. CPRD and HES data only provide information
from where individuals have accessed healthcare, and diagnostic
information has been recorded. Whilst CPRD data is collated directly
from GP records, HES data is an administrative summary of each episode
of care. As such, our analyses measure only diagnosed cases of
conditions and do not capture unmet needs. Whilst this linked primary
care data largely represents the English population registered with
primary care providers, it is slightly less representative compared to
the overall English population: marginalised groups and those from the
most deprived areas are underrepresented. We have modelled dependencies
between certain diseases based on the strength of the correlations and
clinical understanding. In future iterations of the model, we plan to
improve the modelling of disease clusters by including additional
disease-disease interactions.

# Supplementary materials A: Disease module details

The following subsections present the assumptions, data sources,
structural diagram, and validation plots for each condition.

Incidence, prevalence, case-fatality and mortality trends are modelled
using GAMLSS models fitted to the CPRD data by sex, age group,
deprivation decile, and year.

Disease dependencies are where the incidence of the condition of
interest is associated with the prevalence of other condition(s). These
were included based on the strength of correlations and known plausible
directional associations and modelled as relative risks by sex, age
group, and deprivation decile, using logistic regression.

For some conditions, calibration factors were applied based on visual
inspection of the simulated data against the observed data. Two types of
calibration factors were used: intercept and trend. The intercept
calibration factor is multiplied by the simulated incidence to shift it
up (calibration factor \> 1) or down (calibration factor \< 1). The
trend calibration factor is applied as an exponential based on the
number of years since the start of the simulation. For all case fatality
rate plots, the model output is post-calibration to the ONS mortality;
therefore, it is expected to be higher than the CPRD observed mortality.

## Model structure

[Figure A‑1]{.underline} is a 'birds-eye' diagrammatic presentation of
all the relationships modelled between risk factors and conditions and
between pairs of conditions, as described in the above sections. As this
is difficult to read and interpret, the structural diagram for the
relationships affecting each modelled condition is presented alongside
the individual condition summaries in the following sub-sections.

In all the diagrams, conditions are in blue and modelled exposures are
in red. Modelled associations between risk factors and conditions are
shown by the red arrows; modelled associations between prevalent
condition x and incident condition y are shown by the blue arrows.

In the disease-specific sub-sections, the incident condition of interest
is in black text in the centre, and all direct relationships modelled
between exposures and other conditions are shown by the arrows pointing
towards the middle.

## Exposure validation plots 

The following figures are the cumulative probability validation plots
for the modelled exposures in the simulation compared to the observed
Health Survey for England data. Plots are presented by 1) year and
10-year age-group, 2) year and quintiles of IMD.

For the main exposures modelled (alcohol, active days, BMI, fruit and
vegetable intake, smoking prevalence, second-hand smoke exposure, SBP,
total cholesterol), we also present trends in exposures by quintiles of
IMD (unstandardised).

[^1]: The darker the blue, the stronger the association. Prevalent CKD
    was associated with a reduced risk of pain. This is likely to be
    because we measured pain using prescription data in CPRD, and many
    pain medications are contra-indicated for CKD.

[^3]: This is because a diagnosis will likely be picked up in other
