#### Output structure

-   The location of the output folder is determined in the `inputs/sim_design.yaml` file, : `output_dir`, E.g : `/output/hf_real` here.

-   It is advisable not to manually change any files in the **lifecourse**, **xps**, or **summaries** folders.

-   The folders shown below are all the folders generated if we run the baseline scenario as mentioned in [IMPACTncd_Engl - test run](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rJYNErUTgamlyGw94i-RzgzMSVlzyqxW_CJsZBBN34U/edit). If you specified `logs: no` in the *inputs/sim_design.yaml* file, then the logs folder will not be present.


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "output/hf_real folder structure"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/output_folder.jpg")
```

-   The main folders to check initially after running a simulation are **tables**; **summaries**; **lifecourse**; and **xps**

-   Usually **logs** folder is used for debugging as it logs baseline and other scenarios

-   Usually plots remain empty unless we generate plots

-   So here we will be looking at the remaining folders : **lifecourse**; **tables**; **summaries**; **xps**

-   Some important abbreviations used in each of the files generated in the results are shown below

#### File name abbreviations

-   "**dis_char**" : disease characteristics, e.g. age of onset of the condition, mean duration of the condition
-   "**prvl**" : prevalence of each condition
-   "**incd**" : incidence of each condition
-   "**dis_mrtl**" : disease-specific mortality

-   "**le**" : life expectancy; "**le60**" : life expectancy at 60

-   The two different types are for different thresholds for the ‘end’ of healthy years:
    -   "**1st_cond**" : any 1 condition
    -   "**cmsmm1.5**" : CMS score of \> 1.5

-   "**Chd**" : Coronary Heart disease
-   "**pain**" : chronic pain

### lifecourse Folder

The files inside lifecourse folder are as shown below; the number of files generated will be dependent on the number of iterations run for baseline and various scenarios, here it is two; because of the uncertainty in the model, the results will vary between lifecourse files. These files contain the 'lifecourse' for each simulant in the model. Each row represents 1 simulant for each year they are 'alive' in the model, and contains information on their socio demographic and disease information. These files are the direct output of the model and are used to create the 'summaries' files.


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.cap = "lifecourse folder structure"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/output_folder_lf.jpg")
```

#### Column names

-   **pid** : unique person ID
-   **year** : year
-   **age** : age
-   **agegrp** : age group
-   **sex** : sex
-   **dimd** : the decile group of the index of multiple deprivation
-   **ethnicity** : ethnicity
-   **sha** : Geographic region (from Strategic Health Authority)
-   **pid_mark** : TRUE/FALSE marker for whether this is the first year the simulant enters the model
-   **scenario** : scenario identification
-   **mc** : Monte Carlo iteration
-   **cms_score**; **cms_count** : CMS score; CMS count
-   **cms1st_cont_prvl** : Only one CMS condition
-   **cmsmm0_prvl**; **cmsmm1_prvl**; **cmsmm1.5_prvl**; **cmsmm2_prvl** : CMS \> 0; CMS \> 1; CMS \> 1.5; CMS \> 2
-   **X_prvl** : number of years with the condition. If this is 1, this is what is used for the incd summary files & age_onset. If this is \> 0 it counts as a prevalent case
-   **X_dgns** : number of years since diagnosis with the condition. Currently, this is identical to X_prvl. In future versions of the model, we may explicitly model diagnosed and undiagnosed components of disease incidence and prevalence.
-   **wt_esp** : standardised to the 2013 European Standardised Population
-   **wt** : scaled up to the ONS population projection estimates
-   **all_cause_mrtl** : if \> 0 died in that year. The integer is a code for cause of death - you can find the code lookups for all-cause mortality in the `sim_design.yaml` file under. For each condition with an associated cause of death will have a code under the mortality section. Not all conditions will have a cause listed as not all conditionals are lethal in the model. 
E.g.: For type 2 diabetes it is 4.

-   **scenario** : scenario
-   **mc** : Monte Carlo iteration
-   **year** : Year
-   **agegrp** : Age group
-   **dimd** : Decile group of the English Index of Multiple Deprivation
-   **cases** : total number of cases (people with the condition)
-   **all_cause_mrtl_by_dis** : all cause mortality by disease
-   **cms_score** : Cambridge Multimorbidity Score (CMS)
-   **mean_cms_score** : mean Cambridge Multimorbidity Score (CMS)
-   **cms_count** : number of conditions within the CMS

-   **dis_mrtl** : disease-specific mortality
-   **hle_1st_cond**, **hle_cmsmm1.5** : healthy life expectancy; the two different types are for different thresholds for the ‘end’ of healthy years: **1st_cond** - any 1 condition; **cmsmm1.5** = CMS score of \>1.5 incd : incidence of each condition
-   **le** : life expectancy. Note that this is not from birth but from the age the synthetic individuals enter the model that is defined in the `inputs/sim_design.yaml` file. The default is, therefore, life expectancy at 30.
-   **le60** : life expectancy at 60
-   **mrtl** : mortality
-   **mean_age_incd** : mean age of condition incidence
-   **mean_age_1st_onset** : mean age of the first incidence of a condition - some conditions can go into recovery/remission and then re-occur (e.g. asthma, anxiety & depression, etc.). This variable takes the mean age at the first onset
-   **mean_age_prvl** : mean age of everyone with the condition (new and existing cases)
-   **mean_duration** : mean duration that people have had the condition
-   **X_prvl** : the number of people with the condition (new and pre-existing cases) where X is disease

-   **scaled_up** : scaled up to the ONS population projection estimates

[Prevalence file (prvl)]{.underline}\
- **X_prvl** : the number of people with the condition (new and pre-existing cases) where X is a disease \
- **popsize** : total number of people in the strata

[Incidence file (incd)]{.underline}\
- **X_incd** : the number of people with new cases of the condition \
- **popsize** : total number of people in the strata (not just those at risk)

### tables Folder

The files inside the tables folder contain statistical summaries of different parameters based on different groups. The median (\_50.0%) from all iterations is presented alongside two levels of uncertainty: 95% (lower uncertainty interval (LUI): \_2.5%, upper uncertainty interval (UUI): \_97.5%) and 80% (LUI: \_10.0%, UUI: \_90/0%).

The parameters used here are -

**parameter (shortform) {specification of the parameter}**

-   all-cause mrtl (all_cause_mrtl_by_disease_rate){disease}
-   disease characteristics (value) {disease; type}
-   exposure (xps) {exposure}
-   fatality (ftlt) {disease}
-   incidence (incd) {disease}
-   mean CMS count (mean-cms_count) {}
-   mean CMS score (mean_cms_score) {}
-   mortality (mrtl) {disease}
-   pop size (pop_size) {}
-   prevalence (prvl) {disease}

Various standardisations used are `not standardised` (scaled up to the ONS population projections); `age standardised`; `age-dimd standardised`; `age-sex standardised`; `age-sex-dimd standardised`. 
Standardisation is done using the 2013 European Standardised Population (ESP). For standardisation beyond age standardisation, we assume that the population is equally sized between the respective groups and that the age distribution in each follows the 2013 ESP.

The file name is as follows : 

**parameter by multiple-groups (standarisation_if_applied).csv** 

- all-cause mrtl by disease-year (age-sex-dimd standardised).csv 
- disease characteristics by year (not standardised).csv
